Paul Graham writes on [Why to Not Not Start a Startup][1]. Given his success with supporting projects at Y Combinator, his perspective is valuable. His essay presents a case against reasons that he has heard for not creating a startup company.

> <font size="2" face="verdana">So here&#8217;s the brief recipe for getting startup ideas. Find something that&#8217;s missing in your own life, and supply that needâ€”no matter how specific to you it seems. Steve Wozniak built himself a computer; who knew so many other people would want them? A need that&#8217;s narrow but genuine is a better starting point that one that&#8217;s broad but hypothetical. So even if the problem is simply that you don&#8217;t have a date on saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by writing software, you&#8217;re onto something, because a lot of other people have the same problem.</font>
