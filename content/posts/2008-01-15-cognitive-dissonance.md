The following appears in a blog entry about the [bear market][1] (emphasis mine):

> &#8220;People tend to ignore, reject or minimize any information that conflicts with their positive self-image,&#8221; their preconceived ideas and their ideological convictions, says John Nofsinger, Washington State professor of behavioral finance, in &#8220;Investment Madness.&#8221;  
> &#8220;The avoidance of cognitive dissonance can affect the decision-making processes in two ways. First, **you can fail to make important decisions because it&#8217;s too uncomfortable to contemplate the situation**,&#8221; Nofsinger says.  
> People hate conflicting data so much they get nervous when their preconceptions are threatened. Their brain freezes, they self-sabotage and do nothing&#8211;and their worst fears become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  
> The second way we handle conflicting information: &#8220;Your brain will filter out or reduce negative information and fixate on positive information,&#8221; Nofsinger says. Unfortunately, &#8220;if you ignore negative information, how are you going to realize that an adjustment in your portfolio is necessary?&#8221; Plus, you miss lots of opportunities.
