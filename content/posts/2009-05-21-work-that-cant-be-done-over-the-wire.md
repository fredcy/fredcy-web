From [Heidegger and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance][1]:

> [According to Princeton economist Alan Blinder] the labor market of the next decades won&#8217;t necessarily be divided between the highly educated and the less-educated: &#8220;The critical divide in the future may instead be between those types of work that are easily deliverable through a wire (or via wireless connections) with little or no diminution in quality and those that are not.&#8221; Binder goes on to summarize his own take: &#8220;You can&#8217;t hammer a nail over the Internet.&#8221; Learning a trade is not limiting but, rather, liberating. If you are in possession of a skill that cannot be exported overseas, done with an algorithm, or downloaded, you will always stand a decent chance of finding work. Even rarer, you will probably be a master of your own domain, something the thousands of employed but bored people in the service industries can only dream of. 

Working over the internet is freeing because you can do it from anywhere, but the flip-side is that you are then in competition with the entire world
