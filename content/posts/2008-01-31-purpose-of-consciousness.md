Nicholas Humphrey writes about Questioning Consciousness and concludes with this. Concerning the [purpose of consciousness][1], given that it seems not to be essential to anything we do (according to him), he says:

> I think the plain and simple fact is that consciousness—on various levels—_makes life more worth living_.  
> We like _being_ phenomenally conscious. We like _the world_ in which we&#8217;re phenomenally conscious. We like _ourselves_ for being phenomenally conscious. And the resulting _joie de vivre_, the enchantment with the world we live in, and the enhanced sense of our own metaphysical importance have, in the course of evolutionary history, turned our lives around.
