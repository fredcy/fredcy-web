We&#8217;re going to use [trac][1] in conjunction with [subversion][2] to manage the code for our PowerSchool deployment project. The ticket system in trac looks decent. I&#8217;m not so sure about &#8220;milestones&#8221; &#8212; my one attempt to edit a milestone ran into trouble when I entered the date value wrong and fixing that value required entering all the milestone&#8217;s fields from scratch. I either screwed up, or the interaction design of that part of trac is poor.
