In [A Guide to Understanding the Hoax of the Century](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/guide-understanding-hoax-century-thirteen-ways-looking-disinformation), Jacob Siegel presents a history and analysis of recent "anti-disinformation" efforts in the U.S.

I'm skeptical about some of his conclusions but I appreciate the detailed history he presents and I'm increasingly concerned about efforts to control what we (the populace) think because (according to some powers that be)  we can't be trusted to think for ourselves.

> The United States is still in the earliest stages of a mass mobilization that aims to harness every sector of society under a singular technocratic rule. The mobilization, which began as a response to the supposedly urgent menace of Russian interference, now evolves into a regime of total information control that has arrogated to itself the mission of eradicating abstract dangers such as error, injustice, and harmâ€”a goal worthy only of leaders who believe themselves to be infallible, or comic-book supervillains.

> If the underlying philosophy of the war against disinformation can be expressed in a single claim, it is this: You cannot be trusted with your own mind.
