In [A Guide to Understanding the Hoax of the Century](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/guide-understanding-hoax-century-thirteen-ways-looking-disinformation), Jacob Siegel presents a history and analysis of recent "anti-disinformation" efforts in the U.S.

I'm skeptical about some of his conclusions but I appreciate the detailed history he presents and I'm increasingly concerned about efforts to control what we (the populace) think because (according to some powers that be)  we can't be trusted to think for ourselves.
