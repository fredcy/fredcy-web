I think [Scott Adams][1] is right, &#8220;the biggest software revolution of the future is that the calendar will be the organizing filter for most of the information flowing into your life&#8221;. Sharing calendars is still too hard, and when we solve that problem I expect it to be hugely useful. I expected shared calendar technology to become mainstream years ago and it still hasn&#8217;t happened. Just what is the roadblock?
