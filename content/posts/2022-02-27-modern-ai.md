It's quite something to see Artificial Intelligence become capable after so many years of failed promise.

Back in the late 1970s I took a college[^uw] course about AI which surveyed the state of the art. At that time there was very little practical application as the technology was weak; as I remember it, the course was mostly speculative about what *could* be done.

In the 1990s I wrote a simple rule-based application that was intended to help software developers in a large organization[^att] satisfy a set of process requirements. The rules were expressed in a declarative format much like a decision tree, and my program[^smlnj] converted those rules to operational code in a simple survey dialog program. This was perhaps my favorite project in my career.

Not long after that I took a new job with a company that sold a development tool to generate applications using model-based reasoning with automated forward and backward-chaining over rules on an object-oriented framework. Sadly, that company pivoted almost immediately to an entirely different product space and they gave up any new development and most support of their model-based reasoning product.

Since then I've not worked on anything even AI-adjacent -- to my regret.

It was a shock then to learn how AI technology had advanced to where AlphaGo[^alphago] was able to train itself to play Go at a world-master level in just a matter of days, simply by playing games against itself.
