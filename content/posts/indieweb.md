This site is an experiment using the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) approach to posting web content and connecting with other similar sites.
I'm building the site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and with that the [Indigo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/indigo/) that is designed to [support IndieWeb](https://web-work.tools/indieweb/indigo/features/).
