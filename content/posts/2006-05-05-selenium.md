The [Selenium][1] software for testing web apps looks promising. We&#8217;ve got a boatload of pages to get going in our PowerSchool deployment project and I&#8217;m hoping to use something like Selenium to automate some of the testing.

I experimented creating a test using the [Selenium IDE][2] plug-in with Firefox and ran into a glitch right away. The page I&#8217;m testing does a redirect to force the connection into SSL/https. The IDE tool captures the session OK but when I try to run the test from Selenium on the host it hangs at the point where the conversation switches to the SSL port. I tried starting out in SSL but then it hangs when the ultimate page redirects back to a port 80 connection. Rats.
