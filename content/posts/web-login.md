Yesterday I got [web sign in](https://indieweb.org/How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain) working with this site.
With that I'm able to login to [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/) via github.com, which is currently the only supported web-sign-in method for the sites that I've connected with (per the links on the page footer here).
