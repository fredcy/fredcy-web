Yesterday I got [web sign in](https://indieweb.org/How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain) working with this site.
With that I'm able to login to [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/) via github.com, which is currently the only supported web-sign-in method for the sites that I've connected with (per the links on the page footer here).

I've also got this site connected to [webmention.io](https://indieweb.org/webmention.io) which I think will collect and store any cases where other similar sites might link to pages on this site. Eventually I'd like to have full WebMention support on this site, similar to what's described at [IndieWebify Your Hugo Website](https://www.amitgawande.com/indiewebify-hugo-website/).
