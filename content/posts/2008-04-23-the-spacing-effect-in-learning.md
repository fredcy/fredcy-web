The **spacing effect**: it&#8217;s possible to dramatically improve learning by correctly spacing practice sessions. The idea is to rehearse (restudy) when the likelihood of recall drops to certain point. Repeating this flattens the &#8220;forgetting curve&#8221; (likelihood of successfull recall over time).

> Long-term memory, the Bjorks said, can be characterized by two components, which they named retrieval strength and storage strength. **Retrieval strength** measures how likely you are to recall something right now, how close it is to the surface of your mind. **Storage strength** measures how deeply the memory is rooted. Some memories may have high storage strength but low retrieval strength. Take an old address or phone number. Try to think of it; you may feel that it&#8217;s gone. But a single reminder could be enough to restore it for months or years. Conversely, some memories have high retrieval strength but low storage strength. Perhaps you&#8217;ve recently been told the names of the children of a new acquaintance. At this moment they may be easily accessible, but they are likely to be utterly forgotten in a few days, and a single repetition a month from now won&#8217;t do much to strengthen them at all.

> The Bjorks were not the first psychologists to make this distinction, but they and a series of collaborators used a broad range of experimental data to show how these laws of memory wreak havoc on students and teachers. One of the problems is that _the amount of storage strength you gain from practice is inversely correlated with the current retrieval strength_. In other words, **the harder you have to work to get the right answer, the more the answer is sealed in memory**. Precisely those things that seem to signal we&#8217;re learning well — easy performance on drills, fluency during a lesson, even the subjective feeling that we know something — are misleading when it comes to predicting whether we will remember it in the future. &#8220;The most motivated and innovative teachers, to the extent they take current performance as their guide, are going to do the wrong things,&#8221; Robert Bjork says. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost sinister.&#8221;

> I find myself thinking of a checklist Wozniak wrote a few years ago describing how to become a genius. His advice was straightforward yet strangely terrible: You must clarify your goals, gain knowledge through spaced repetition, preserve health, work steadily, minimize stress, refuse interruption, and never resist sleep when tired.
