According to [FirstRead][1],

> the Iraq war&#8217;s effect on American politics can&#8217;t be understated, even 10 years later 

So, according to that, anything that can be said is overstating the effect. One can&#8217;t state anything less about the effect.

Of course, they mean &#8220;should not be understated&#8221; rather than &#8220;can&#8217;t be understated&#8221;. But they could probably care less.
