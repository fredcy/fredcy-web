Here is some good stuff from the closing section of the _Mindsets_ book by Carol Dweck:  
&#8220;When people change to a growth mindset, they **change from a _judge-and-be-judged_ framework to a _learn-and-help-learn_ framework**.  
Every day presents you with ways to grow and to help the people you care about grow. How can you remember to look for these chances? Each morning, as you contemplate the day in front of you, try to ask yourself these questions.

  * _What are the opportunities for learning and growth today? For myself? For the people around me?_

As you think of opportunities, form a plan, and ask:

  * _When, where and how will I embark on my plan?_ 

When, where, and how make the plan concrete.  
As you encounter the inevitable obstacles and setbacks, form a new plan and ask yourself the question again:

  * _When, where and how will I act on my new plan?_ 

Regardless of how bad you may feel, do it!  
And when you succeed, don&#8217;t forget to ask yourself:

  * _What do I have to do to maintain and continue the growth?_
