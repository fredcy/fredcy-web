Here is an excerpt from &#8220;Looking for a Garde of Which to be Avant: An Interview with David Foster Wallace&#8221; as it appeared in the Spring 1993 issue of Whiskey Island magazine published by Cleveland State University.

> But there are a few books I have read that I&#8217;ve never been the same after, and I think all good writing somehow addresses the concern of and acts as an anodyne against loneliness. We&#8217;re all terribly, terribly lonely. And there&#8217;s a way, at least in prose fiction, that can allow you to be intimate with the world and with a mind and with characters that you just can&#8217;t be in the real world. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re thinking. I don&#8217;t know that much about you as I don&#8217;t know that much about my parents or my lover or my sister, but a piece of fiction that&#8217;s really true allows you to be intimate with &#8230;. I don&#8217;t want to say people, but it allows you to be intimate with a world that resembles our own in enough emotional particulars so that the way different things must feel is carried out with us into the real world. I think what I would like my stuff to do is make people less lonely. Or really to affect people.
