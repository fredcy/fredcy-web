Here are some sources I've found useful and which seem reliable.

* [Interactive visualization from John Hopkins data](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/)

* [Worldometer: global](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

* [Worldometer: US](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)

* [Johns Hopkins map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)

* [Financial Times tracker](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest)
(incorporates some of the above)

* [COVID-19 projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections)

* [The Peter Attia Drive Postcast](https://peterattiamd.com/podcast/)

(The CDC seems to have stopped incorporating state data into its totals starting about March 16, so I don't find their data useful.)
